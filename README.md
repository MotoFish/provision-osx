# provision-osx
Provisions a new OSX host for use at MotoFish

To provision a new host at MotoFish open Terminal and type:

git clone https://github.com/MotoFish/provision-osx.git && cd provision-osx && ./go

Be patient, it will take a while to run.  In the mean time you can safely continue to use your computer and let Terminal churn away.

Enjoy!
